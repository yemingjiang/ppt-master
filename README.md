Drop in a PDF, DOCX, URL, or Markdown — get back a **reviewable presentation skeleton first** (`main_content.md`, `design_spec.md`, `preview/index.html`), then a **native-editable PowerPoint** when the structure is approved.

> **How it works** — PPT Master is a workflow (a "skill") that works inside AI IDEs like Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code + Copilot, or Codebuddy. You chat with the AI — "make a deck from this PDF" — and it first builds a reviewable skeleton package and HTML draft on your computer. Once that draft is approved, the repo-local native-editable rebuild produces the final `.pptx`. No coding on your side; the IDE is just where the conversation happens.
>
> **What you'll do**: install Python, install an AI IDE, drop in your material. First-time setup is about 15 minutes. Each deck takes ~10–20 minutes of back-and-forth with the AI.

**[Why PPT Master?](./docs/why-ppt-master.md)**

There's no shortage of AI presentation tools — what's missing is one where the output is **actually usable as a real PowerPoint file**. I build presentations every day, but most tools export images or web screenshots: they look nice but you can't edit anything. Others produce bare-bones text boxes and bullet lists. And they all want a monthly subscription, upload your files to their servers, and lock you into their platform.

PPT Master is different:

- **Review-first, editable-final** — instead of pretending one pass can do everything, PPT Master gets the structure reviewed first and only then rebuilds the final deck natively for manual editing
- **Real PowerPoint where it matters** — the preferred final path is a native editable rebuild, not a screenshot export or a flattened web snapshot
- **Transparent, predictable cost** — the tool is free and open source; the only cost is your own AI editor, and you know exactly what you're paying. As low as **$0.08/deck** with VS Code Copilot
- **Data stays local** — your files shouldn't have to be uploaded to someone else's server just to make a presentation. Apart from AI model communication, the entire pipeline runs on your machine
- **No platform lock-in** — your workflow shouldn't be held hostage by any single company. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, and more; supports Claude, GPT, Gemini, Kimi, and other models

## Built by Hugo He

I'm a finance professional (CPA · CPV · Consulting Engineer (Investment)) who got tired of spending hours on presentations that could be automated. So I built this.

PPT Master started from a simple frustration: existing AI slide tools export images, not editable shapes. As someone who reviews and edits hundreds of slides in investment and consulting work, that was unacceptable. I wanted real DrawingML — click on any element and change it, just like you built it by hand.

This project is my attempt to bridge the gap between **domain expertise** and **product engineering** — turning a complex professional pain point into an open-source tool that anyone can use.

## Support This Project

PPT Master is built and maintained by one person, fully self-funded. Every new template, bug fix, and documentation update runs through AI models that cost real money — and right now those token bills come out of my own pocket.

If PPT Master has been helpful to you, consider chipping in. Sponsorship directly funds more templates, faster fixes, and keeps this project free and open-source.

**Individual sponsorship**

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

**You only need Python.** Everything else is installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

| Dependency | Required? | What it does |
|------------|:---------:|--------------|
| [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.10+ | ✅ **Yes** | Core runtime — the only thing you actually need to install |

> **TL;DR** — Install Python, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and you're ready to generate presentations.

<details open>
<summary><strong>Windows</strong> — see the dedicated step-by-step guide ⚠️</summary>

Windows requires a few extra steps (PATH setup, execution policy, etc.). We wrote a **step-by-step guide** specifically for Windows users:

**📖 [Windows Installation Guide](./docs/windows-installation.md)** — from zero to a working presentation in 10 minutes.

Quick version: download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) → **check "Add to PATH"** during install → `pip install -r requirements.txt` → done.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS / Linux</strong> — install and go</summary>

```bash
# macOS
brew install python
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Edge-case fallbacks</strong> — 99% of users don't need these</summary>

Two external tools exist as fallbacks for edge cases. **Most users will never need them** — install only if you hit one of the specific scenarios below.

| Fallback | Install only if… |
|----------|-----------------|
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+ | You need to import WeChat Official Account articles **and** `curl_cffi` (part of `requirements.txt`) has no prebuilt wheel for your Python + OS + CPU combination. In normal setups `web_to_md.py` handles WeChat directly through `curl_cffi`. |
| [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) | You need to convert legacy formats: `.doc`, `.odt`, `.rtf`, `.tex`, `.rst`, `.org`, or `.typ`. `.docx`, `.html`, `.epub`, `.ipynb` are handled natively by Python — no pandoc required. |

```bash
# macOS (only if the above conditions apply)
brew install node
brew install pandoc

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install nodejs npm
sudo apt install pandoc
```
</details>

### 2. Pick an AI Editor

| Tool | Rating | Notes |
|------|:------:|-------|
| **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/)** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Best results — native Opus, largest context |
| [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) / [VS Code + Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/) | ⭐⭐ | Good alternatives |
| Codebuddy IDE | ⭐⭐ | Best for Chinese models (Kimi 2.5, MiniMax-M2.7) |

### 3. Set Up

**Option A — Download ZIP** (no Git required): click **Code → Download ZIP** on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/hugohe3/ppt-master), then unzip.

**Option B — Git clone** (requires [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hugohe3/ppt-master.git
cd ppt-master
```

Then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To update later (Option B only): `python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/update_repo.py`

### 4. Create

**Provide source materials (recommended):** Place your PDF, DOCX, images, or other files in the `projects/` directory, then tell the AI chat panel which files to use. The quickest way to get the path: right-click the file in your file manager or IDE sidebar → **Copy Path** (or **Copy Relative Path**) and paste it directly into the chat.

```
You: Please create a PPT from projects/q3-report/sources/report.pdf
```

**Paste content directly:** You can also paste text content straight into the chat window and the AI will generate a PPT from it.

```
You: Please turn the following into a PPT: [paste your content here...]
```

Either way, the AI will first confirm the design spec:

```
AI:  Sure. Let's confirm the design spec:
     [Template] B) Free design
     [Format]   PPT 16:9
     [Pages]    8-10 pages
     ...
```

The AI handles the full front half — content analysis, design spec, SVG skeleton generation, support files, and HTML review draft — and then hands the confirmed package to the native editable rebuild step for final `.pptx` production.

> **Default output:** a reviewable skeleton package in the project directory — `main_content.md`, `design_spec.md`, `style_sheet.md`, `asset_manifest.md`, `notes/`, `svg_output/`, and `preview/index.html`.
>
> **Final editable output:** after review, hand the confirmed package to [`skills/ppt-master-native-editable/SKILL.md`](./skills/ppt-master-native-editable/SKILL.md) to rebuild the final native editable `.pptx`.
>
> **Legacy compatibility output:** `ppt-master` can still export `.pptx` directly through `svg_to_pptx.py`, but that is now an explicit compatibility path rather than the preferred editable-delivery route.

> **AI lost context?** Ask it to read `skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md`.

> **Something went wrong?** Check the **[FAQ](./docs/faq.md)** — it covers model selection, layout issues, export problems, and more. Continuously updated from real user reports.

### 5. AI Image Generation (Optional)

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # then edit with your API key
```

```env
IMAGE_BACKEND=gemini                        # required — must be set explicitly
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview
```

Supported backends: `gemini` · `openai` · `qwen` · `zhipu` · `volcengine` · `stability` · `bfl` · `ideogram` · `siliconflow` · `fal` · `replicate`

Run `python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/image_gen.py --list-backends` to see tiers. Environment variables override `.env`. Use provider-specific keys (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.) — global `IMAGE_API_KEY` is not supported.

> **Tip:** For best quality, generate images in [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) and select **Download full size**. Remove the watermark with `scripts/gemini_watermark_remover.py`.
